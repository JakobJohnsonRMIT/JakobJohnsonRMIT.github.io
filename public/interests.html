                    What is your interest in IT?
                </strong>
                <br>
                I am most interested in the IoT area of IT because I enjoy the combination of programming, networking and hardware prototyping.
                I am also interested in cyber security, cryptography, ethical hacking and gaming.

                    When did your interest in IT start?
                </strong>
                <br>
                I have played video games since I was a young boy. I always wanted to be a game developer or tester, anything in the gaming industry. 
                After I completed my auto electrician certificate, I continued to learn on my own & built circuits with Arduino, which also introduced me to programming and the other fields in the IT industry.

                    Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?
                </strong>
                <br>
                Not Really, more of a continuation of learning. The more I learn, the more curious I become.
                Elon Musk is obviously a big inspiration for anyone in tech, but someone like David Schwarts from ripple I look at with awe and hope I can achieve the things they have.

                    Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
                </strong> 
                <br>
                I chose RMIT university because it offered the course I needed entirely online. They also allowed me to work my way into the course if I didn't meet the pre-requisites.

                    What do you expect to learn during your studies?
                </strong>
                <br>
                I expect to learn the IT industry's in's and out's and how to make sure I have a long and successful career.
                One thing I hope to learn and improve on would be the presentational side of IT and being a professional in the office.
