                    What do the results of these tests mean for you? 
                </strong>
                <br>
                    The results I received are relatively close to my expectations; I think it was pretty accurate after reading through the definition of an Assertive Advocate, diplomat, and confident individualism for the Myers Briggs test.
                <br>
                    The online learning style test was no surprise. I have studied online before and feel comfortable with my ability to do so.
                <br>
                    The logical reasoning test was a test I think employers would find helpful when assessing a new employee I scored well on this test also.
                <br>
                    The results of these test I hope indicate that i would be suitable for a role in the IT industry.

                    How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
                </strong>
                <br>
                    The results of the Myers Briggs test may indicate I will have difficulty being heard or getting my point across in a team as I am 73% introverted. I will need to keep this at the front of my mind and do my best to participate.

                    How should you take this into account when forming a team? 
                </strong>
                <br>
                    When forming a team, it would be a good idea to try and group with people whose strengths are similar to your weakness' and vice versa.
                <br>
                    Also, it may be beneficial to pick team members of equivalent skill level and knowledge to yourself.
